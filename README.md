Excited to share my latest mini-project,
I recreated a simplified version of the Fresh Cart website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. 
This was a great learning experience, and I'm continuing to build my front-end development skills.

ðŸ“Œ How to Use?
1) Clone this repo:  git clone https://github.com/vaishnavi7997/fresh-cart-project.git
2)Open any .js file and run it in the browser console or Node.js.
